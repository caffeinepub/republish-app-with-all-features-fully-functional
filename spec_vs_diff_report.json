REQ-2 (UI polish) is addressed via index.css, tailwind.config.js, and all component files. REQ-3 (hero redesign) is addressed in HomePage.tsx with full-width layout, gradient background, hero image, and aspirational headline. REQ-4 (footer enhancement) is addressed in Footer.tsx with mission CTA banner and honest tagline. The two required images are referenced in the code.
