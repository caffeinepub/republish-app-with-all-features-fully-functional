# Specification

## Summary
**Goal:** Polish the Vitals AI Hospital website with aspirational, honest messaging and a premium UI refresh across all public-facing pages and components.

**Planned changes:**
- Replace all fabricated or unverifiable statistics (patient counts, satisfaction percentages) with aspirational, mission-driven copy throughout the homepage, hero section, stats bar, departments section, and footer
- Redesign the hero section with a bold full-width layout, strong aspirational headline, honest subheadline, prominent CTA button, and a premium visual background
- Perform a comprehensive UI polish pass across all pages (HomePage, Header, Footer, LandingPage, RoleSelector): tighten spacing and vertical rhythm, refine typography hierarchy, add premium card/section styling with subtle depth (shadows, glassmorphism), smooth hover/scroll micro-animations, and cohesive teal/emerald/cyan color usage
- Enhance the footer with a concise mission statement tagline, clean layout, proper visual separation, and full responsiveness — removing any inflated claims
- Use new hero background and global-reach images to elevate visual quality

**User-visible outcome:** Visitors see a polished, trustworthy hospital website with aspirational but honest messaging, a striking hero section, premium UI styling, and a cohesive professional look across all screen sizes.
