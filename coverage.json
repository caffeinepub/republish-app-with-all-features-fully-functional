Improvements must include: (1) tighter, more intentional spacing and padding with consistent vertical rhythm; (2) refined typography — stronger visual hierarchy with clear heading scales, improved line-height and letter-spacing for readability; (3) elevated visual hierarchy so the most important content commands attention immediately; (4) premium card and section styling with subtle depth (shadows, borders, glassmorphism where appropriate); (5) smooth, tasteful animations and micro-interactions on scroll and hover; (6) cohesive color usage leveraging the existing teal/emerald/cyan palette defined in tailwind.config.js with proper contrast ratios; (7) a fully polished mobile layout with responsive breakpoints.",
