  "summary": "All four requirements (REQ-48 through REQ-51) have been successfully implemented. The PWA manifest.json was created with appropriate metadata and teal theme color, index.html was updated with the manifest link, a QRCodeGenerator component was created with display and download functionality, and it was integrated into the AdminDashboard as a dedicated tab.",

      "description": "QR code uses teal color (#14b8a6) for the QR code dots themselves, not just border styling",
      "reason": "REQ-50 specifies the QR code should be 'displayed in a card with teal borders matching the existing design theme' and 'styled consistently with the Flipkart-inspired teal design aesthetic'. The diff shows the QR code generation uses dark: '#14b8a6' for the QR code pattern itself, which goes beyond just card borders. While this maintains design consistency, it exceeds the literal requirement.",
