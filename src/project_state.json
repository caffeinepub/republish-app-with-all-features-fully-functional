  "summary": "Complete hospital management application with role-based access (Patient/Doctor/Admin), AI-powered medical report analysis and symptom assessment (Vitals AI), doctor allocation system, emergency SOS, Flipkart-inspired UI design, and customer support contact system. Home page should only display a 'Get Started' button, leading to role selection (Patient/Doctor/Admin). Admin verification uses Internet Identity with principal-based authentication instead of email verification. A circular customer support button displaying satyamjha2553@gmail.com is fixed to the right bottom corner of every page. All features (triage, doctor allocation, etc.) should be displayed in flashcards throughout the interface.",

    "App must be production-ready, not a prototype",
