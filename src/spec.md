# Specification

## Summary
**Goal:** Update the UI color scheme to greenish-blue teal and refine spacing for a professional, minimalistic appearance.

**Planned changes:**
- Change primary UI colors from light blue to greenish-blue teal throughout the application
- Update card borders to use the new teal color with prominent/flashy styling
- Refine spacing (padding, margins, whitespace) across all components for a clean, professional look
- Ensure all existing functionality continues to work after UI updates

**User-visible outcome:** The application displays a refreshed greenish-blue teal color scheme with improved spacing and visual polish while maintaining all existing features.
